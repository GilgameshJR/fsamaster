I developed FSM guru in JavaScript during the "logical networks" course attended during my BSc. The tool was originally meant to generate execises for the students and show them how to execute such exercises.
The tool, according to specifications such as the number of states, number of inputs and probabilities, type (Moore, Mealy) and others, generates a finite state machine. Subsequently, the tool simplifies the generated machine and possibly implements it according to several type of flip-flops and encoding (Binary or One-Hot). The generation of a machine is not a necessary step: the tool can directly simplify and implement existing machines, showing step-by-step the simplification procedure.
